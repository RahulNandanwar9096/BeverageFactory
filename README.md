# BeverageFactory
We are the owners of a beverage factory which serves a variety of drinks, juices etc to the customers from its pre-defined set of menu Items. We offer the customers a choice to customize their drinks in case they want to avoid some specific ingredients from their drinks, e.g. a person ordering "Chai Latte" which has ingredients as "tea leaves, milk, water, sugar, condiments" a person can order a chai latter without sugar and condiments. The order value is recalculated based on the actual price of the menu minus the price of the removed ingredient. So if 1 Cup Chai costed 5 $ and sugar costed 0.5 $ and milk costed 1$ the order: "Chai, - sugar, -milk" would charge 5 - 0.5 - 1.0=3.5$ for the order. The order to be placed to the shop is always a String concatenated by exclusions.  1. "Chai, -sugar" 2. "Chai, -sugar, -milk" 3. "Chai" 4. ["Chai, -sugar", "Chai", "Coffee, -milk"] // Chai and Tea are menu items are all valid orders. As a part of this exercise you have to write a program should be able to compute the total price of the order placed. Remember the order can only be a String.
